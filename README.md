# BSUIR Databases Coursework
> Final project for databases course in 6th semester

The goal of the project was to implement a front-end interface to a database. 
This was achieved with Python and its Flask framework; binding of front-end interface controls to database entities was done 
using Flask's SQLAlchemy addon. Front-end pages were rendered using Jinja2 templating language.
